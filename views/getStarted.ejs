		<h1>Getting Started</h1>
		The first step would be to <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/">create Scratch projects</a>(or pick pre-existing ones). If you don't have a Scratch account, then you should make one, and create some projects.
		<h2>Ideas for Clutters</h2>
		Here are some ideas for clutters.
		<ul>
			<li><h3>Create a Story</h3>
			Create a story or comic book series, and combine them on Clutter.</li>
			<li><h3>Make a Game Series</h3>
			Compile your game series into a single place!</li>
			<li><h3>Make a Show</h3>
			Create edisodes of a show, and make a easy to find place for all of them.</li>
			<li><h3>Create an Art Gallery</h3>
			Take your art, and put it into a gallery, for everyone to enjoy.</li>
			<li><h3>Create a compilation album</h3>
			Show of you're own original music, or music you just generally like.</li>
			<li><h3>Compile your favorite projects</h3>
			Make an easy place to access your personal favorite projects by you.</li>
			<li><h3>Compile boring and repetitive things</h3>
			Make things, then make it again, and again, and again, and again. Like how this page is boring and repetitive.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Still don't know what to make?</h2>
		Well too bad... because I can't think of anything else.<br>
		But seriously, I have no more ideas.
