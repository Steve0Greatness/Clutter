Clutter is an editor where you can... make Clutters. It's partially based off of the original one from Scratch 1.4. However, it's only based in name and basic function.

Please note that this repo will not be up to date with the website. This is because the website is hosted via Replit, and sometimes I like to make too many changes before commiting to the repo

## Website
The website has a simple design intented for it to look nice.

## Editor
The editor is easy to use, it takes seconds to create a Clutter
